Abstract:
The non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system can be rigorously
derived using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach. Although this
formalism is exact, practical numerical implementations often require
compromises. The time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation offers an exact
framework, yet its application typically relies on a perturbative expansion of
both the time forward and time backward state propagators. Due to the
significant computational effort involved - and the scarcity of analytical
solutions for most open quantum systems - the fourth-order perturbative TCL
generator (TCL4) has only been benchmarked on a limited range of systems and
parameter spaces. Recent advancements, however, have made the computation of
TCL4 faster and more accessible. In this paper, we benchmark the TCL4 master
equation against numerically exact methods for the biased spin-boson model. We
focus on the regime near critical bath coupling where perturbative master
equations are expected to become inaccurate. Our findings reveal that the TCL4
approach is most reliable at low temperature and more efficient than the
numerical exact methods. This study aims to delineate the conditions under
which the TCL4 perturbative master equation enhances the accuracy of the TCL2.
