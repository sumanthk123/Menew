Depending\\non the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of\\ngraphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our\\nexperiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\\\\%$ from their initial\\nvalue. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also\\nnoticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show\\nthat the QHP extension for $\\\\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two\\nregions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by\\ncarrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-B\\\\\"uttiker\\nformalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of\\nimpurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of\\nthe QHPs.

Building on this, we design a new weakly supervised\\nviolence detection framework that consists of unimodal multiple-instance\\nlearning for extracting unimodal semantic features, multimodal alignment,\\nmultimodal fusion, and final detection.

In sampling theory, for instance, it is standard to assume the availability\\nof an orthonormal basis for computations, ensuring that numerical errors are\\nnegligible. In reality, however, this assumption is often unmet. In this paper,\\nwe discard it and demonstrate the advantages of integrating numerical insights\\nmore deeply into sampling theory. To clearly pinpoint when the numerical\\nphenomena play a significant role, we introduce the concept of numerical\\nredundancy. A set of functions is numerically redundant if it spans a\\nlower-dimensional space when analysed numerically rather than analytically.\\nThis property makes it generally impossible to compute the best approximation\\nof a function in its span using finite precision. In contrast,\\n$\\\\ell^2$-regularized approximations are computable and, therefore, form the\\nfoundation of many practical methods. Regularization generally reduces accuracy\\ncompared to the best approximation, but our analysis shows that there is a\\nbenefit: it also significantly reduces the amount of data needed for accurate\\napproximation. Furthermore, we present a constructive method for optimally\\nselecting data points for $L^2$-approximations, explicitly accounting for the\\neffects of regularization. The results are illustrated for two common scenarios\\nthat lead to numerical redundancy: (1) approximations on irregular domains and\\n(2) approximations that incorporate specific features of the function to be\\napproximated. In doing so, we obtain new results on random sampling for Fourier\\nextension frames.

By accounting for\\ncompilation error and circuit noise, we demonstrate that time evolution and\\nquantum Fourier transformation circuits achieve high compression rates, while\\nrandom quantum circuits are less compressible. The degree of compression is\\nrelated to the rate of entanglement accumulation in the target circuit. In\\nparticular, experiments on IBM platforms achieve a compression rate of $12.5$\\nfor $N=12$, significantly extending the application of current quantum devices.\\nFurthermore, large-scale numerical simulations for system sizes up to $N=30$\\nreveal that the optimal depth $d_{\\\\mathrm{max}}$ to achieve maximal overall\\nfidelity is independent of system size $N$, suggesting the scalability of our\\nmethod for large quantum devices in terms of quantum resources.', 'Authors': 'Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang', 'Published Date': '2025-01-13', 'Link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07387v1'}, {'Title': 'Forecasting for monetary policy', 'id': 1193, 'Abstract': \"This paper discusses three key themes in forecasting for monetary policy\\nhighlighted in the Bernanke (2024) review: the challenges in economic\\nforecasting, the conditional nature of central bank forecasts, and the\\nimportance of forecast evaluation.

Based on the binary\\ncharacteristics of SNNs, we first propose a novel supervised hashing method\\nnamed Spikinghash with a hierarchical lightweight structure. Spiking WaveMixer\\n(SWM) is deployed in shallow layers, utilizing a multilevel 3D discrete wavelet\\ntransform (3D-DWT) to decouple spatiotemporal features into various\\nlow-frequency and high frequency components, and then employing efficient\\nspectral feature fusion. SWM can effectively capture the temporal dependencies\\nand local spatial features. Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) is deployed in deeper\\nlayers to further extract global spatiotemporal information. We also design a\\nhash layer utilizing binary characteristic of SNNs, which integrates\\ninformation over multiple time steps to generate final hash codes. Furthermore,\\nwe propose a new dynamic soft similarity loss for SNNs, which utilizes membrane\\npotentials to construct a learnable similarity matrix as soft labels to fully\\ncapture the similarity differences between classes and compensate information\\nloss in SNNs, thereby improving retrieval performance. Experiments on multiple\\ndatasets demonstrate that Spikinghash can achieve state-of-the-art results with\\nlow energy consumption and fewer parameters.', 'Authors': 'Zihao Mei, Jianhao Li, Bolin Zhang, Chong Wang, Lijun Guo, Guoqi Li, Jiangbo Qian', 'Published Date': '2025-01-12', 'Link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06786v1'}, {'Title': '3DCoMPaT200: Language-Grounded Compositional Understanding of Parts and Materials of 3D Shapes', 'id': 1794, 'Abstract': \"Understanding objects in 3D at the part level is essential for humans and\\nrobots to navigate and interact with the environment.

A detailed\\ninvestigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable\\nisotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to\\naccurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to\\nfailure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are\\nsuperimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is\\nintroduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage,\\ndifferent stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split\\nproving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and\\nstiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth\\ntransitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the\\ndeviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is\\ngoverned by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing\\ndifferential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient\\nterms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the\\nplasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone\\ntest and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension\\nspecimen.', 'Authors': 'Alireza Daneshyar, Dorina Siebert, Christina Radlbeck, Stefan Kollmannsberger', 'Published Date': '2025-01-12', 'Link': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06745v1'}, {'Title': 'Enabling Cardiac Monitoring using In-ear Ballistocardiogram on COTS Wireless Earbuds', 'id': 1835, 'Abstract': 'The human ear offers a unique opportunity for cardiac monitoring due to its\\nphysiological and practical advantages.
